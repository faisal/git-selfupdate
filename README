git-selfupdate
==============

Tired of manually downloading the sources and building git?  Too lazy to
type three commands when you could just type one?  Don't really mind if a
security violation on kernel.org cascades down to your desktop?

$ which git-selfupdate
~/bin/git-selfupdate
$ git selfupdate
Usage:  [sudo] git-selfupdate version
$ sudo git selfupdate 1.6.1.2
