git-selfupdate
==============

Tired of manually downloading the sources and building git?  Too lazy to
type three commands when you could just type one?  Don't really mind if a security violation on 

$ which git-selfupdate
~/bin/git-selfupdate
$ git selfupdate
Usage:  git-selfupdate version
$ git selfupdate 1.6.1.2
